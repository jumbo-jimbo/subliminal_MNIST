# subliminal_MNIST
test1.ipynb is an attempt at replicating MNIST experiment from https://github.com/MinhxLe/subliminal-learning . 

test2.ipynb contains some modifications styled after the upload of https://github.com/MinhxLe/subliminal-learning/blob/main/scripts/run_mnist_experiment.py . Much higher accuracy in the student.

run_many will run 100 different seeds. Not optimized at all, takes way too long to run. But for 40 times, average student accuracy is around 43%.
